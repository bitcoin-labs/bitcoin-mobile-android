    // receiving coins. If a tx is both inbound and outbound (spend with change) it is considered outbound for the
    // purposes of the explanation below.
    //
    // 1. Outbound tx is created by us: ->pending
    // 2. Outbound tx that was broadcast is accepted into the main chain:
    //     <-pending  and
    //       If there is a change output  ->unspent
    //       If there is no change output ->spent
    // 3. Outbound tx that was broadcast is accepted into a side chain:
    //     ->inactive  (remains in pending).
    // 4. Inbound tx is accepted into the best chain:
    //     ->unspent/spent
    // 5. Inbound tx is accepted into a side chain:
    //     ->inactive
    //
    // Re-orgs:
    // 1. Tx is present in old chain and not present in new chain
    //       <-unspent/spent  ->inactive
    //
    //       These newly inactive transactions will (if they are relevant to us) eventually come back via receive()
    //       as miners resurrect them and re-include into the new best chain. Until then we do NOT consider them
    //       pending as it's possible some of the transactions have become invalid (eg because the new chain contains
    //       a double spend). This could cause some confusing UI changes for the user but these events should be very
    //       rare.
    //
    // 2. Tx is not present in old chain and is present in new chain
    //       <-inactive  and  ->unspent/spent

    // 1. Sum up all unspent outputs of the transactions in unspent.
